# Genie Parser

Genie is both a library framework and a test harness that facilitates rapid
development, encourage re-usable and simplify writing test automation. Genie
bundled with the modular architecture of pyATS framework accelerates and
simplifies test automation leveraging all the perks of the Python programming
language in an object-orienting fashion.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting early 2018 through [Cisco DevNet].
