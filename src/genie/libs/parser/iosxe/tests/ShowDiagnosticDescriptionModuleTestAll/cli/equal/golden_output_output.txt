TestGoldPktLoopback :
        The GOLD packet Loopback test verifies the MAC level loopback
        functionality. In this test, a GOLD packet, for which ASIC
        provides the support in hardware, is sent. The packet loops back
        at MAC level and is matched against the stored packet. It is a
        non-disruptive test.

TestFantray :
        This test verifies all fan modules have been inserted and working
        properly on the board. It is a non-disruptive test and can be
        run as a health monitoring test.

TestPhyLoopback :
        The PHY Loopback test verifies the PHY level loopback
        functionality. In this test, a packet is sent which loops back
        at PHY level and is matched against the stored packet. It is a
        disruptive test and cannot be run as a health monitoring test.

TestThermal :
        This test verifies the temperature reading from the sensor is
        below the yellow temperature threshold. It is a non-disruptive
        test and can be run as a health monitoring test.
