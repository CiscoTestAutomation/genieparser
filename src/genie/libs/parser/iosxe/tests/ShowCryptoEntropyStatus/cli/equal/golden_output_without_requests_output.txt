# Entropy source       Type Status  Entropy Bits
1 ACT-2                 HW  Working  384
2 randfill              SW  Working  128(*)
3 getrandombytes        SW  Working  160(*)

Secure mode enabled
(*) - The entropy collected from SW sources were not counted as a part of
      achieving the entropy target

Fresh entropy collected once every 60 minutes
Entropy most recently collected 10 minutes ago
Entropy target = 256 bits; entropy actually collected = 384 bits
